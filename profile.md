#Who We Are

###Cody Klegraefe

Cody is a junior majoring in computer science. He taught himself programming in high school, and learned from his first two years at UMass that he was an awful teacher. Web development is a bit of a mystery to him, but he's eager to get started. In the past, Cody found Greek Mythology and Greek Archaeology to be pretty cool.
